## **Decoding Energy Consumption: ML Predictions & Model Comparison in East Melbourne WWTP**


ðŸ“Œ  **Project Overview**

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential for environmental sustainability, but their energy-intensive operations pose cost and carbon emission challenges. This project focuses on the East Melbourne Wastewater Treatment Plant, aiming to predict energy consumption (EC) based on organic, hydraulic, and climatic parameters and compare the performance of various machine learning models.

ðŸ”¹ **Objectives**

Identify key factors influencing energy consumption in WWTP operations.

Develop and compare machine learning and deep learning models for EC prediction.

Evaluate model robustness, efficiency, and predictive accuracy using historical data.

Provide actionable insights to optimize energy usage and enhance sustainability.
